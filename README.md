The goal of this project was to redesign the skip selection page while maintaining its core functionality. The redesign focuses on:

- **Modern UI/UX**: Clean, intuitive interface with clear visual hierarchies
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop views
- **Maintainable Code**: Well-structured TypeScript React components with proper separation of concerns
- **Material-UI**: Leveraging Material-UI (MUI) for consistent design patterns and components

## Implementation Approach

### Architecture

The project follows a component-based architecture with:

- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **React**: For building the UI components
- **Material UI**: For design system and component library
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with responsive breakpoints

   - Tablet: Two column layout
   - Desktop: Three column layout
4. **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of selected items, interactive hover states
5. **Navigation Controls**: Intuitive back/continue buttons with appropriate state management

### Code Quality

- **Component Structure**: Logically separated components for better maintainability
